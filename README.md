I have wanted to learn how to use the command line for quite some time, and now that summer is approaching, i fugured using ruby and git in the bash terminal would be the perfect place to start. My goal for ruby is to create a simple text based game. My goal for git is to memorise basic commands, such as commit, ammend, pull, and push. For each day, I will start a new .ru file, until I start working on the actual game. This will be a messy repository. 




I, for one, would never see the need to spend time looking at this type of repoisitory, so if you have come this far, you must have have across something that catches your interest. If you don't mind, plese create an issue to tell me why you are here, as I would love to know. Have a great day.

:)
